Premnas biaculeatus, commonly known as spine-cheeked anemonefish
 Or the maroon clownfish, is a species of anemonefish found in the Indo-Pacific from western Indonesia to Taiwan and the great Barrier Reef.
They can grow up to be about 17 cm.
 Like all anemonefishes it forms a symbiotic mutualism with sea anemones and is unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone.
 It is a sequential hermaphrodite with a strict size-based dominance hierarchy.
